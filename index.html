                    <p>Leaping at the opportunity of being part of a young and promising team building a useful product from sunny Lisbon, André joined the early ranks of <a href="http://www.uniplaces.com">UniPlaces</a> in April 2013 to lead the front-end development and assist in proving the validity of the pivot in the business model through a user-centered effort.</p>

                    <p>The effort came into frution when, 7 months later, the company successfuly raised $1,000,000 from Octopus Investments, with a track record of impressive growth supported by the launch of the MVP in June and maturity over the next months.</p>

                    <p>André had been working at <a href="http://www.sapo.pt"><abbr title="Serviço de Apontadores POrtugueses">SAPO</abbr></a>&mdash;a local company to the likes of Yahoo!&mdash;for 4 years when he was challenged to be part of the team as Lead Front-end Engineer that would go ahead to redesign the #1 most visited website produced in Portugal: <a href="http://www.sapo.pt">www.sapo.pt</a>.</p>

                    <p>With <abbr title="30 million">30M</abbr> monthly visits, its audience made it incredibly challenging to deliver not only a Responsive solution, but a future-friendly one: resolution-independent, device and browser agnostic but also usable and enjoyable. It strived to be a modern example of bleeding edge good practices but also universally accessible as much as possible.</p>

                    <p>He also worked closely with the sales team on defining, designing and implementing an unobtrusive commercial solution to a high-impact multimedia responsive ad format that allowed advertisers to reach audiences that were until then restricted to small almost static graphic banners (mobile formats).</p>

                    <p>SAPO is a web company born out of the 90s portals. It has grown to become the most important and most used network of content-producing websites in Portugal.</p>
